# OIDC Lite - Samples

This repository contains sample applications showcasing various functionalities of the OIDC Lite project.

1. `src/consent.js` - This sample demonstrates the capability of consent based logins to facilitate logins in third party applications.

2. `src/consent-less.js` -  This sample demonstrates the capabilities of consent less logins to facilitate logins in first party applications.

3. `src/pkce.js` - This sample demonstrates for the capability of PKCE based login with `code_challenge` and `code_verifier`

All these samples use the generic OIDC Strategy of `passport.js` which is a generic strategy compliant with the OpenID Connect protocol. These samples working fine with an instance of OIDC Lite showcase that the OIDC Lite has a correct OIDC Compliant implementation.
